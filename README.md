## Invoices Creater
  This page help to create Invoices. You need to specify your name, date and invoice number, then add products. Finally, just click create, then one history will be added. I use localstorage to store those invoices, but I didn't implement the fetch part. So you would not see the invoices you created before.

###How to use it?
  1.Download the files
  2.Open index.html
  3.Enter your Name, Date and Invoice Number
  4.Use search bar to search products
  5.Select items with an initial number
  6.You could modify numbers in the "Selected Items" part
  7.If you try to add an existing item again, it will not work.
  8.Click Create, an history item will show.
  9.Click that item, you will see details.
